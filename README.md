# TrafiGO Szcz
An application that will allow you to check the public transport timetable in Szczecin.<br>
Fully coded in Swift using the Combine framework and MVVM design pattern.
<br>
<br>
Most of the public transport tracking apps available do not include Szczecin. This is due to the fact that the Road and Public Transport Authority in Szczecin does not provide a friendly API for developers. This application uses the WebKit framework to retrieve data and convert it into JSON objects.
<br>
1. The app on the home screen shows pins with all public transport stops in Szczecin.

<br>

2. After selecting a specific stop, the application displays the planned arrivals of public transport. Live data is downloaded (if the vehicle has a GPS module installed), if not, arrivals are displayed by timetable.

<br>

3. The user can also search for a bus stop by his name. After clicking on the name, the map centers on the stop and displays the timetable.
